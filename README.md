## **Introduction**

With the growing need for secure, streamlined authentication processes, integrating Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Jenkins using Single Sign-On (SSO) is a valuable approach for organizations leveraging both Azure AD and Jenkins for development and operations. Azure AD SSO enables users to access Jenkins using their organizational credentials, improving security and convenience by eliminating the need for multiple logins and reducing the risk of password fatigue and unauthorized access. 

Jenkins, a widely-used continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server, often hosts sensitive data and critical deployment pipelines. Integrating Azure AD SSO offers a way to manage access securely and efficiently, using the robust identity management capabilities of Azure AD to safeguard access to Jenkins.

This guide outlines the steps to configure Azure AD SSO for Jenkins, aiming to enhance security, streamline user management, and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

## **Security Requirements**

For a successful Azure AD SSO integration with Jenkins, certain security requirements need to be met:

1. **Azure AD Account with Appropriate Permissions**:
   - The Azure AD account used to configure SSO must have permissions to create and configure applications within the Azure AD tenant. Admin permissions are required to grant necessary API permissions and to register the Jenkins application in Azure AD.

2. **Client Secret Management**:
   - Securely handle the client secret generated in Azure AD, which acts as a password for Jenkins to authenticate users via Azure AD. Regularly update the secret and set expiration policies in alignment with organizational security requirements.

3. **API Permissions and Admin Consent**:
   - Ensure the application has the required Microsoft Graph API permissions, specifically `openid` and `profile`, to authenticate and retrieve user profile information. Granting admin consent to these permissions organization-wide allows smooth operation without requiring individual user consent.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Setup**:
   - Implement role-based access control within Jenkins by mapping Azure AD groups to Jenkins roles, restricting access based on the principle of least privilege. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to Jenkins jobs, configuration, and sensitive information.

5. **Secure Redirect URIs**:
   - Use secure (HTTPS) redirect URIs for production Jenkins instances. This prevents interception or redirection attacks during the authentication process.

6. **Regular Auditing and Logging**:
   - Configure logging and auditing within Jenkins to monitor and track access attempts, especially for critical actions, ensuring compliance with security policies.

By meeting these security requirements, organizations can establish a secure integration between Azure AD and Jenkins, enhancing both access security and user management efficiency.

## **Objectives**

The primary objectives of integrating Azure AD SSO with Jenkins include:

1. **Centralized Identity and Access Management**:
   - Simplify user management by centralizing authentication through Azure AD, enabling users to log in with their corporate credentials and reducing the need for separate Jenkins accounts.

2. **Enhanced Security and Compliance**:
   - Use Azure AD’s identity protection features, like multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and robust password policies, to secure Jenkins access and ensure compliance with organizational security standards.

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Eliminate the need for multiple logins by enabling a seamless SSO experience, reducing password fatigue, and ensuring ease of access for developers, administrators, and stakeholders.

4. **Simplified Access Control with Role-Based Access**:
   - Map Azure AD groups to Jenkins roles, enabling structured access control based on job functions. This aligns with the principle of least privilege, where users only receive access relevant to their responsibilities.

5. **Secure Integration of CI/CD with Organizational Authentication Policies**:
   - Align Jenkins CI/CD workflows with corporate security standards by leveraging Azure AD’s managed authentication and authorization capabilities, strengthening the overall security posture.

### **Part 1: Registering Jenkins as an Application in Azure AD**

#### **Step 1.1: Log into the Azure Portal and Register a New Application**
1. **Go to Azure Portal**: Visit [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with an account that has permissions to register applications.
2. **Access Azure AD**:
   - In the Azure Portal, locate **Azure Active Directory** in the left sidebar. Azure AD manages identity and access for users within your organization.
3. **Register a New Application**:
   - In the **App registrations** section, click **New registration**. This will create a new application that represents Jenkins in Azure AD, allowing Azure AD to control and secure access.
4. **Set Application Details**:
   - **Name**: This name is for identification in Azure. Use something descriptive, like “Jenkins SSO.”
   - **Supported account types**:
     - Choose **Single tenant** if only people within your Azure AD tenant (your organization) will access Jenkins.
     - Choose **Multi-tenant** if Jenkins needs to be accessible by users from other Azure AD tenants.
   - **Redirect URI**:
     - Set the type as **Web**.
     - This URI tells Azure AD where to send users after authentication. This URI must match your Jenkins instance’s URL. If Jenkins is running locally (for testing), use something like `http://localhost:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin`. For production, set it to your Jenkins domain, like `https://<your-jenkins-domain>/securityRealm/finishLogin`.
   - Click **Register** to create the application. This registers Jenkins as a secure Azure AD application and creates a unique ID for it.

#### **Step 1.2: Save Application IDs**
1. **Application (client) ID**: This unique identifier for the application is called the **Client ID** in Jenkins configuration. Copy this, as Jenkins will use it to identify itself when communicating with Azure AD.
2. **Directory (tenant) ID**: This ID represents your Azure AD directory (tenant). Jenkins will use this ID to locate your Azure AD tenant for authentication. Copy and save this for later.

#### **Step 1.3: Generate a Client Secret**
1. In **Certificates & secrets**, Azure allows you to create a **Client Secret**. This secret will act like a password for Jenkins to securely connect to Azure AD.
2. **Client Secret Details**:
   - **Description**: Enter a description to help identify this secret (e.g., "Jenkins SSO Secret").
   - **Expires**: Choose an expiration time. If you want a more secure setup, use shorter expiration times and regularly update this secret.
3. Click **Add**. The secret will display only once—**copy it** immediately and store it securely. You’ll enter this as the **Client Secret** in Jenkins.

#### **Step 1.4: Set API Permissions**
1. **API Permissions** allow Jenkins to request specific information from Azure AD during authentication.
2. **Add Required Permissions**:
   - Under **API permissions**, click **Add a permission** > **Microsoft Graph**.
   - **Microsoft Graph** is a unified API for accessing Azure AD data, such as user profiles.
   - Choose **Delegated permissions** (since the application operates on behalf of the user).
   - **openid**: This permission allows the application to authenticate users.
   - **profile**: This provides access to the user’s basic profile information (name, email, etc.), which Jenkins can use for identifying the user.
3. **Grant Admin Consent**:
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**. This action confirms the permissions on behalf of all users in the organization, so they won’t need to consent individually.

### **Part 2: Configuring Jenkins for Azure AD Authentication**

#### **Step 2.1: Install the Azure AD Plugin in Jenkins**
1. **Manage Plugins**:
   - Open Jenkins and go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins**. Jenkins plugins add new features and integrations, and the Azure AD plugin allows Jenkins to integrate with Azure AD for SSO.
2. **Search for the Plugin**:
   - Under the **Available** tab, search for **Azure AD Plugin**. This plugin enables the Azure AD authentication mechanism in Jenkins.
3. **Install the Plugin**:
   - Select the Azure AD Plugin and click **Install without restart**. This will install the plugin so it’s ready to use.

#### **Step 2.2: Configure Azure AD Settings in Jenkins**
1. **Enable Security Realm**:
   - In Jenkins, go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security**.
   - In **Security Realm**, select **Azure Active Directory**. The Security Realm handles user authentication and authorization. By selecting Azure AD, you’re allowing Azure AD to control who can log into Jenkins.
2. **Enter Azure AD Details**:
   - **Client ID**: Paste the **Application (client) ID** from Azure AD.
   - **Client Secret**: Paste the **Client Secret** generated in Azure AD.
   - **Tenant ID**: Paste the **Directory (tenant) ID**.
3. **Advanced Settings** (Optional):
   - **Cache Duration**: This controls how long Jenkins caches user information. Shorter cache durations are more secure but may affect performance.
   - **Post-Logout URL**: Enter the URL where users should be redirected after logging out (e.g., your Jenkins homepage or organization’s website).

#### **Step 2.3: Set Up Authorization Roles in Jenkins**
1. **Authorization Strategy**:
   - In **Configure Global Security**, go to the **Authorization** section. Authorization in Jenkins determines what actions a logged-in user can perform.
2. **Matrix-based Security or Role-based Strategy**:
   - **Matrix-based security**: Allows fine-grained control over each user or group’s permissions.
   - **Role-based strategy** (requires the Role Strategy Plugin): Allows you to define roles (like Admin, Developer, Viewer) and assign users or groups to these roles.
3. **Add Users and Groups**:
   - If using **Role-based strategy**, define roles with specific permissions, then add Azure AD groups and users. Jenkins will map Azure AD users to these roles automatically.
4. **Permissions for Each Role**:
   - Define permissions for each role. For example:
     - **Admin**: Full access to Jenkins.
     - **Developer**: Access to job creation and builds, but no admin controls.
     - **Viewer**: Read-only access.
   - If using **Matrix-based security**, manually add user permissions by entering Azure AD usernames or group names.

### **Part 3: Testing Azure AD SSO Integration**

#### **Step 3.1: Log Out of Jenkins**
- **Sign Out**: To simulate the experience for an end user, log out of Jenkins.

#### **Step 3.2: Log In Using Azure AD**
1. On the Jenkins login page, you may see an option to **Sign in with Azure AD**.
   - Alternatively, clicking **Login** should redirect you to the Azure AD login page, where users can enter their Azure AD credentials.
2. **Authenticate with Azure AD**:
   - Enter your Azure AD username and password. Azure AD will validate your credentials and, if successful, redirect you back to Jenkins.
3. **Access Control in Jenkins**:
   - Once logged in, users should have permissions based on the roles or groups you configured.
   - If a user doesn’t have access, check that their Azure AD group is mapped correctly in Jenkins and that permissions are assigned as expected.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Redirect URI Mismatch**:
  - Ensure the redirect URI configured in Azure AD exactly matches the Jenkins callback URL.
- **Permissions Errors**:
  - If Azure AD denies access, confirm that the **openid** and **profile** permissions were added and that admin consent was granted.
- **Client Secret Expiry**:
  - If SSO suddenly fails, check if the client secret has expired. You can generate a new secret in Azure AD, then update Jenkins.
- **Role and Group Mappings**:
  - Ensure group names in Azure AD match those in Jenkins if using group-based authorization. Typos or name mismatches will prevent Jenkins from applying the correct roles.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing Azure AD SSO for Jenkins is an effective way to enhance security, simplify user management, and improve the user experience. By configuring Azure AD as the identity provider for Jenkins, organizations can leverage the security and compliance capabilities of Azure AD, such as MFA, conditional access, and centralized identity management, to safeguard their CI/CD environment.

This integration aligns Jenkins with corporate authentication standards, providing a streamlined, single sign-on experience for users and ensuring a robust security posture for Jenkins workflows. With proper configuration and maintenance, Azure AD SSO with Jenkins provides a scalable, secure solution that meets modern security requirements while supporting the dynamic needs of development and operations teams.
